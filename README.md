Phantom Folder Concept

 A little idea were i head were theres a hidden folder that continuously changes its name and location, making it significantly harder to discover! It would be hider to  find with you the user knowing of its existence. By frequently altering itself, the folder could effectively hide from conventional searches, providing enhanced privacy and security for sensitive information...dubbing it the Phantom Folder.


 P.S > When running it it will disapear with no one to locate where the folder went so
 be sure to change the  new_dir into a location of your choice :>
