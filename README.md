Phantom Folder Concept

 A little idea were i head were theres a hidden folder that continuously changes its name and location, making it significantly harder to discover! It would be hider to  find with you the user knowing of its existence. By frequently altering itself, the folder could effectively hide from conventional searches, providing enhanced privacy and security for sensitive information...dubbing it the Phantom Folder.


P.S. When running the program, the folder will disappear without a trace, making it difficult for anyone to locate it. Be sure to change new_dir to a location of your choice!
